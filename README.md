A simple mood tracker for use with HealthBox

**Please note**: Feather is very early in development, so many of the features and explanations here are not yet accurate. This document will be updated over time as the project gets developed.


## Supported Platforms

Feather is still early in development, so things are likely to change, but tenatively, these are the platforms I expect to support.

- GNU/Linux
- Android


## Usage

Feather is designed to be as simple and quick to use as possible. The quicker you can log your emotions, the more likely you are to do it frequently, and the better chances you have of developing useful information about emotional patterns!

The first time you use Feather, you'll need to configure it. Without configuration, Feather can't connect to your HealthBox instance, making it useless. It should be noted the it is not possible to run Feather without first having HealthBox set up. To learn more about HealthBox, see <https://v0lttech.com/healthbox.php>.

1. Download and run Feather on the platform of your choice.
2. At the bottom of the interface, click the `Configure` button. This should open the configuration section.
3. In the `HealthBox Server And Port` field, enter the server and port of your HealthBox instance. For example, if you're running HealthBox on your local machine, you may enter `localhost:5050` here. If you're running on a LAN device, you might enter `192.168.0.29:5050`.
4. In the `HealthBox API Key` field, enter an API key generated by HealthBox. The API key should be a `source` key, and have permission to access the `Mood (B7)` metric.
5. Press the `Apply` button to Apply your configuration changes.
6. Click the `Configuration` button once again to hide the configuration section.
7. At this point, you should be able to click a button to indicate your mood, the press `Submit`.


## Features

### Lightweight

Just as you'd expect from a program with the name 'Feather', it's extremely lightweight and is completely capable of running on outdated hardware without draining your battery. It launches in a split seconds, and the interface is highly responsive.

### Quick

After the initial configuration, Feather is built in such a way that you can go from opening the app to logging a mood in a matter of a few seconds! This means you'll be able to log your mood whenever you have a few seconds free, allowing you to make frequent records of your emotions.

### Native UI

Feather is built using each of it's platforms native UI libraries, meaning it will mesh perfectly with your other applications!

### Completely Open Source

Feather is competely open source from the ground up, making it easy for anyone to modify it, study it, or review its privacy practices.

### Works With HealthBox

Feather is designed to work with HealthBox, the easy way to store all of your health information in a centralized place. This makes it easy to cross reference your mood with other health metrics, like physical activity and nutrition.
